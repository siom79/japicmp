-------------------
* japicmp now also supports tracking of source incompatible changes. [#59](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/59)
* The XML report now also outputs the reason for each change for better traceability. [#105](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/105)
* The maven plugin comes now with the new option `breakBuildBasedOnSemanticVersioning` that breaks the build based on the version numbers of the old and new archive(s) assuming they are using semantic versioning. [#108](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/108)
* The maven plugin now has a new option `packagingSupported` that lets you define for which packaging types the plugin should be invoked. This is useful when the plugin is defined in the root pom and should be executed for all submodules, but you want to exclude some of these submodules by packaging type.

* It is now possible to provide separate classpaths for the old and new version ([#61](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/61)).
* You can now provide a classifier for the old and new version ([#73](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/73)).
* The maven plugin provides now an option to specify a separate CSS file for the HTML report ([#63](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/63)).

-------------------
* The maven plugin now also includes transitive dependencies ([#65](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/65)).

0.5.0 (2015-05-26)
-------------------
* The parameters `--exclude` and `--include` have been extended such that next to packages now also classes, methods and fields can be excluded or only included. The syntax is similar to the one used for javadoc references: `package.to.include;package.ClassToInclude;package.Class#methodToInclude();package.Class#fieldToInclude`. Please note that the separator char has changed from `,` to `;`. This was necessary as the `,` is now used to separate the arguments for a method in `package.Class#methodWithParams(long,int)` ([#51](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/51)).
* Parameters classes for methods with the same name but different signatures are no longer resolved through the classpath ([#55](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp/issues/55)).
