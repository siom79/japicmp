        -i <includes>, --include <includes>
            Semicolon separated list of elements to include in the form

        --ignore-missing-classes
            Ignores all superclasses/interfaces missing on the classpath.

        --ignore-missing-classes-by-regex <ignoreMissingClassesByRegEx>
            Ignores only those superclasses/interface missing on the classpath
            that are selected by a regular expression.

        --include-exclusively
            Include only packages specified in the "include" option, exclude
            their sub-packages

        --include-synthetic
            Include synthetic classes and class members that are hidden per
            default.

        -m, --only-modified

        -n <pathToNewVersionJar>, --new <pathToNewVersionJar>

            separate jar files.

        --old-classpath <oldClassPath>
            The classpath for the old version.

        --report-only-filename
            Reports just filenames (not full paths) in report description.

        --report-only-summary
            Reports only a breakdown of classes and their status

        --error-on-binary-incompatibility
            Exit with an error if a binary incompatibility is detected.

        --error-on-source-incompatibility
            Exit with an error if a source incompatibility is detected.

        --error-on-modifications
            Exit with an error if any change between versions is detected.

        --no-error-on-exclusion-incompatibility
            Ignore incompatible changes caused by an excluded class
            (e.g. excluded interface removed from not excluded class) when
            deciding whether to exit with an error.

        --error-on-semantic-incompatibility
            Exit with an error if the binary compatibility changes are
            inconsistent with Semantic Versioning. This expects versions of
            the form Major.Minor.Patch (e.g. 1.2.3 or 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT).
            See http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html for more information about
            Semantic Versioning.

        --ignore-missing-old-version
            When --error-on-semantic-incompatibility is passed, ignore
            non-resolvable artifacts for the old version.

        --ignore-missing-new-version
            When --error-on-semantic-incompatibility is passed, ignore
            non-resolvable artifacts for the new version.

```

When your library implements interfaces or extends classes from other libraries than the JDK and you want to evaluate binary
compatibility you must specify the classpath for the two different versions:

    java -jar japicmp-0.24.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -n new-version.jar -o old-version.jar --new-classpath other-library-v2.jar
        --old-classpath other-library-v1.jar

In case the classpath for both versions did not change, you can add the library using the standard way:

	java -cp japicmp-0.24.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar;otherLibrary.jar japicmp.JApiCmp -n new-version.jar -o old-version.jar

For reporting purposes you can also provide more than one jar as old or new version(s):

	java -jar japicmp-0.24.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -o lib1-old.jar;lib2-old.jar -n lib1-new.jar;lib2-new.jar
